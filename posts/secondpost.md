A two year plan is almost a joke when there is so much to let go of. There is no way in two years I can be doing worse. It's why I'm doing this and why the plan exists. I'm still getting flak but I only see an opportunity to do better. My first post was about RESTING. I feel better leading up to this than I have felt in my recent past and it's from I'm working on myself with intention. 

I get upset when my brother talks to me. He questions me and points out the things he doesn't understand, things like this, moodboards, 2yrplan, the blogs. He tries to listen but I end up feeling misunderstood. Am I delusional? People are scared of me. My best friend accuses me of fearmongering. Is that because I made @aurself, @austinayurveda, and @narangi_sona instagram accounts, and developed nargis and fybr over the last two months? Are you scared because I made so many things so quick? I'm exhausted, and there you have it. The number one reason I am doing moodboards is because I am emotional. I'm getting dragged down by the physical and mental side-effects of being emotional. It's such a big spend of time, and such a big waste of energy. I LOVE YOU EMOTIONS. You're affecting MY RELATIONSHIPS & I.

Listening to other people is no longer important to me. I am letting go. There is so much I have to let go of. I am letting go every day and every second. I let go.

## Work

I made the following ig's to interact with the world in new ways. Moodboards and the two year plan are all about me, but I don't want that to be the only thing I work on. How glum.

Personal consulting and professional consulting, @aurself 
A wellness service with food options, @austinayurveda
The digital collective, @narangi_sona

Other: @chepeaustin, a business for my second family / @satnamgrewalrealtor, a business for my mom

My blogs at this moment are <a href="https://nargis.netlify.app/">nargis</a> and <a href="https://fybr.netlify.app/">fybr</a>.

This is everything for now.

I have to set some specific, measurable, acheivable, realistic time-bound goals, I'll post on next post.
