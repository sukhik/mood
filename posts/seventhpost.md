Why can't I live in the present?

## KISS ME

The most important work I can do right now is the chop shop. I must complete the bodeguita conversion. I am getting too interrupted to work on my shit.

Next, for some reason, is the landscaping of the side and backyards, and getting storage for the outdoor tools and everything. I have to keep my sights on this project, because it's only mine. I am the project owner for this one, and I have to keep working on it. I am also worried about my tiny cherry tree babies and my okra. I am concerned about growing more food, and treating all the over growth as well.

For myself, I need to establish my writing routines and learning times, my schedules, the whole nine yards. I am feeling too slow, I am feeling like I am not achieving enough or producing enough. I feel like I am losing time.

Outside the shed, outside the landscaping and keeping the house in order, and my constant affair with my writing and journaling, I have other goals. I am trying to get my body weight down 10 pounds. This is really tough because I overeat. I started exercising everyday indoors, and what I am going to try to do on my disabled body is work. 

I wrote TWO to THREE posts already and deleted them due to interruptions. I am going to try to work on my anxiety and my inner-self. I am looking for my higher self. I am looking for myself to guide me. 

I think the only thing I can do right now is stop. It's always the only thing I can do.

I am fragmented this second. I have people waiting on me everywhere to do other shit than compose this piece. Bye bye for now.
