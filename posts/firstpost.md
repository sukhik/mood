The two year plan isn't new. I started thinking about it a long time ago. I dreamed of changing and visualized it throughout my life. I kept adapting to the world around me. I survived but I experienced even the happiest moments of my life through pain. My choices and behavior held me back. I saw the world through a fog, and ran after people who hurt me. Until yesterday, I was bogged down by my attachment to them. I didn't do anything for myself. I didn't stick up for myself. To be my best self, I needed more time, and I needed them. I needed help, I needed support. I cried a lot. I would cry for my mom. I put everything off. I regret not living my life and begging to be in their lives. I'm so embarrassed.

I learned how to push websites to the internet so I made this blog. I am now saving myself and fixing my world. I care so much about myself and I want to be well. I want to get rid of the bad feelings and my bad life so I made the two year plan to take me out of my horrid misery. A soul cleanse is a tall order so the fixed point of time at which this work will be evaluated is two years in the future. I am giving myself two years to get the fuck over everything which has happened to me.

## June 2020 - June 2022

Plain and simple I want a better life. I want people to stop fucking with me. My number one goal at the end of this project will be to have a reputation. 

At present, it's five or six days before I start this and I am resting. I am fried from my life, the experiences and relationships. Obviously, this is not what I am shooting for. I spent last week developing my programming for the immediate future and on calendaring. For the next few days til June I'm going to be practicing. It's a soft launch, my soft opening. Here I go. THe last thing I want to say is, watch the fuck out.
