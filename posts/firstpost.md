The two year plan isn't new. I started thinking about it a long time ago. I dreamed of changing myself and continued to visualize it throughout my life. I kept adapting to the world around me. I survived but experienced even the happiest moments of my life in pain. My choices and behavior held me back. I saw the world through a fog, and ran after people who hurt me. Until yesterday, I was bogged down by my attachment to them. I didn't do anything for myself. I didn't stick up for myself. To be my best self, I needed more time, and I needed them. I needed help, I needed support. I cried a lot. I would cry for my mom. I put everything off. I regret not living my life and begging to be in their lives. I am very embarrassed.

I learned how to push websites to the internet so I made this blog. I am now saving myself and fixing my world. I care so much about myself and I want to be well. I want to get rid of the bad feelings and my bad life so I made the two year plan to take me out of the horror of my misery. A soul cleanse is a tall order so the fixed point of time at which this work will be evaluated is two years in the future. I am giving myself two years to get over everything which has happened to me.

## June 2020 - June 2022

Plain and simple I want a better life. I want people to stop fucking with me. My number one goal at the end of this project will be to have a better reputation. 

At present, it's five or six days before I start this and I am resting. I am fried from my life, the experiences and relationships I experienced. This is obviously not what I am shooting for. I spent last week developing my programming for the immediate future and on calendaring efforts. For the next few days til June I'm going to be resting and practicing the programming. It's a soft launch, my soft opening. Here I go. The last thing I want to say is: This is your warning.
