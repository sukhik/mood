The two year plan isn't new. I started thinking about it a long time ago. I regularly dreamed of changing myself and visualized it throughout my waking life. I didn't commit to any changes but kept adapting to the world around me while trying to build a support system of people who would help me. I have been really let down. I was attached to people I couldn't let go of. These people were holding me back. Until yesterday, I was bogged down by my attachment to these people who didn't care about me. I always needed more time, and I never needed anyone else.

Upon realizing this today I turned a new leaf. There are things I'm doing which I must stop doing, and there are things I'm not doing which I must. A soul cleanse is a tall order so the fixed point of time at which this work will be evaluated is two years in the future.
