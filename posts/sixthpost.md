2yrplan time. Well, what's going on? What state am I in, what's my status? Inquiring minds want to know. 

## Hi

Okay. I'm fine. I'm challenged. I am having beauty problems. Body problems. Problems of the most serious kind: time problems. Texas is the furnace of earth. I am anxious. My thoughts are moving too fast.

This post, I arranged the tags in an orderly fashion and I will touch on each tag with a category paragraph to stay focused and keep it light. But fast. But light. But chill. But FAST but light.

### CALANDARING

I have discovered timeblocking and now my entire days are spoken for with abstract ideas of what I want to do, from morning rituals 6-8am, working out 9-10, all the way to work and activities and night rituals til 11pm. The protocol was developed last week, I began and I like it a lot. My challenge at this moment is beginning my day with those routines and ending my days on time as planned. There are a lot of other kinks in my system and I am not using the system to my advantage at this moment.

### DAILY ROUTINE

I need to exercise more. I need to follow my heart and my body. I need to do my self-care and my proper self-work, self-listening before careening into opportunities and hunting and deciding on my prey. I find I wake up thinking about work and jumping on my computer. There is not any method of self-preservation or protection I have in place from the feeling where I have all these options and then, so much to do. I want so approach my days with a much more calm mind. I am stressed out by this, by my shortcomings. After I finish this post, instead of writing to FYBR like I want to, or finishing my assignment for my NEW NEWS cryptocurrency writing job....I need to spend that time on myself and sit in my body. Drop in and lay down dead in myself to hear what I am saying to myself and what my body is saying to itself.

### NEW NEWS

Obviously, there is some career related stuff. I am putting my technical writing skills to use operating for a research company reporting on the digital asset class of cryptocurrency. And UGH! It's hard and it sucks and it comes to $5 an hour, just about, doesn't it. Do I want to be a writer? Do I want to be a guy? Do I want to be in tech? Am I into crypto? How adapabtable am I proving to be? Do I want to stretch out my brain? Do I like the challenge? Is it like money?  Yes, no, no no...a lot, yes, yes...no. Haha.

Next, I might be hired by Google. Now, THAT would be unexpected and crazy. I hope I get the job. I just want to make myself proud, even though that feeling goes away so fast for me. Not lasting.

### WRITING

Did I address this a little? I am a paid writer. I am a technical writer but so new to blockchain, financial assests and cryptocurrency that it is a fruitless, meaningless, stupidless blur, a payless job. This is how I feel, of course, nominally I love the achievement, the sense of achievement delivering one paragraph loaded with researched information about a specific asset..it's quite good. 

I want to write for myself, creatively and techincally, this doesn't matter, but what I am understanding is how I hate deadlines, hate doing stuff for others, hate that the sections I am meant to write are my responsibility. I am fearful I am not good enough. Fearful to reveal myself. Fearful I can't do it. Ready to give up. I would like to write my own novel but for four months or so, I have not.

### WEATHER

Who cares, it's super hot.

### UGHHH

Self-improvement. I have to write an entire post on this one. I am spent.

### GOALS

Here we go, in time order:

1. Work out, sit in your body, hit the mat, do the stretch, do the dead, listen in and listen to yourself sing to yourself. Make it the most beautiful part of your day, your existence.

2. Hit FYBR with that rates post, with the minimalism post, the paring back, the "not having shit is the new having shit" post. You can do it! You love that, you love going through what you're going through.

3. Reflect on nargis.....apply nargis, do nargis code name nargis.

4. Finish the dreaded ChainLink report. Don't cry.

5. You got SCLUB in the evening and train from 7-9.

6. Return to moodboards, return to the 2yr, you had additional stuff to put down...make a more organized post. More organized than this lol, than by tags.

Ok Sukhi, nice notes to self.

Ciao-
