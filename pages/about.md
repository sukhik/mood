I made a two year plan to make more time for myself. Everything begins in June 2020 and is given a two year time-horizon. The following is what I am doing and what I'm tracking for the term of this project. This is The Plan.

##### Visual, Performance Art, and Music

I want to maintain a studio practice while experimenting with new materials in new mediums to create goods. I want to compose music and learn music theory, train my voice and practice musical instruments while listening to more music, curating more playlists, DJing and VJing. I really want to sing.

##### Screenwriting, Creative Writing, Radio/Television/Film

I'm taking a 6-week screenwriting class, and learning about film and cinematography. I want to do something meaningful with this: tell stories, work with my friends. I plan to ship sophisticated content to every writing project I started this year. Getting the sites live took some time but summer provides an opportunity to begin writing and scheduling around the writing. I am composing a book and these digital publications are like my warmup.

##### Personal and Professional Development

Instead of working, I am working on myself. I won't accept a job offer until spring 2021. I want a full-time job at that time but not sooner. Until then, I really need to be alone and work privately. I want to be healthy and well. I want to be peaceful. There should be no pressure on me for the duration of my project. I am interested in building out the businesses and ventures I started.

##### Physical Care

Using a beauty/exercise regimen and nutrition, I want to change my looks and body. I have to get in better shape. I want to increase my fitness and make no excuses, overcoming all aspects of the body which keep me down. I am investing in good sleep and the correct morning, afternoon, and evening routines for me. I need to fix my posture and breathing. It is important to improve my image because I would like to be better integrated and more confident in society and be the subject of photos and video.

##### Culture, Internet, Information and Collaboration

I want to store and use the work of other contemporaries for my reference. I will keep a list, curating and maintaining my own archive...moodboards. My defensible worldview will come from this body. The collection will be representative of my state of mind. Learning and practicing Hindi, Punjabi, French, and Spanish remains very important to me. Collaboration and working with others is also important to me.

##### The Truth About Home

The last and largest thing is coming to terms with what has happened in my family. This is all I can say and remain karmically clear. In two years, I want to have gone through enough with myself and my own work that my life and childhood don't matter and the rest of my past doesn't matter anymore. This is my coming of age and these are the end of my twenties. I want to forget you.
