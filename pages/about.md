In a reaction to the world around me, I made a two year plan. Everything begins in June 2020 and is given a two year time-horizon. I wrote the following in terms of what I'm tracking. This is The Plan.

##### Visual, Performance Art, and Music

I want to maintain a studio practice while experimenting with new materials in new mediums to create goods. I want to compose music and learn music theory, train my voice and practice musical instruments while listening to more music, curating more playlists, DJing and VJing. I really want to sing.
Goals: Sell Art

##### Screenwriting, Creative Writing, Radio/Television/Film

I'm taking a 6-week screenwriting class and teaching myself how to use a camera for film and photography at the same time. I want to do something important with this know-how: create shows to tell stories, start my own YouTube channel. I also plan to ship sophisticated content to every writing project I started this year. Getting the sites live took some time. Summer provides an opportunity to begin writing and scheduling around the writing.
Goal: Get a paid writing job.

##### Personal and Professional Development

Instead of working, I am working on myself. I won't accept a job offer until spring 2021. Then, I want to start working and I want to make a ton of money. Until then, I really want to be alone and find enough time to do everything I want. I want to be healthy and well. I want to be peaceful. There should be no pressure on me for the duration of my project.
Goal: Start working Spring 2021

##### Physical Care

Using an beauty/exercise regime and nutrition, I want to change my looks and body. I have to get in better shape. I want to increase my fitness and make no excuses, overcoming all aspects of the body which keep me down. I am investing in good sleep and the correct morning, afternoon, and evening routines for me. I need to fix my posture and breathing. It is important to improve my image because I would like to be better integrated and more confident in society and be the subject of photos.
Goal: 115-119 lbs of lean muscle with corrected posture and tongue position in breathing

##### Culture, Internet, Information and Colllaboration

I want to store and use the work of other contemporaries in my moodboards. I will keep a list, curating and maintaining my own archive. My defensible worldview will come from this body. The collection will be representative of my state.
Goal: Be consistent

##### The Truth About Home

The last and largest thing is coming to terms with what has happened in my family. This is all I can say and remain karmically clear. In two years, I want to have gone through enough with myself and my own work that my life and childhood don't matter and the rest of my past just doesn't matter anymore. This is my coming of age and these are the end of my twenties. I want to forget you.
Goal: Move On
