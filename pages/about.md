2020-2022 Moodboards between many projects, I keep track. I have a two year plan and I am opening up about it. Everything begins in June 2020 and I will post on progress with related materials and further reading. I wrote the following in terms of what I am doing. 

###### Visual, Performance Art, and Music

I am interested in making drawings and painting. I want to use new materials in new mediums as well. I would like to learn new design software. I am also interested in critical theory and politics, performance and social art. I care about making music. I want to train my voice. I am learning how to play guitar and piano. I want to learn how to record, mix, and produce my own sounds. I really want to sing.

##### Screenwriting and Creative Writing

I've just started a screenwriting class. I want to do something important with this knowledge. I plan to maintain all the writing projects which were created this year until 2022. Getting the sites live took some time, but I think summer provides an opportunity to let the writing begin. Screenwriting class is over in five weeks. By that time, I will also have learned to use a camera for photography and film.

#### Personal and Professional Development

Instead of working, I am working on my self. I do plan to work at the end of the first year of this project. In spring 2021, I want to work and I want to make a lot of money. Until then, I really want to be alone and find enough time to do everything I want. I want to be healthy and well.

### Physical Care

I want to change my looks and body with fitness and nutrition. Good sleep and exercise must become a much larger investment. I care about improving myself and I want to be the best looking version of myself I can be. The strongest, leanest, and most atheletic. The happiest. It is important to improve my image because I would also like to be in my own movies if possible, be the subject of photos and in society, also. 

## Culture, Internet, Information and Colllaboration

Beautiful worlds exist on the internet, and I find sites and the work of other contemporaries I want to use better, store, and steward. I will keep a list.

# The Truth About Home

The last and largest thing is coming to terms with what has happened in my family. What has happened to me, and what has happened to them. That's all I have to say. In two years, I want to have gone through enough therapy that this and the rest of my past just doesn't matter anymore.
