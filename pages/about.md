I made a two year plan to make more time for myself and develop my latent talent. Everything is given a two year time-horizon beginning in June 2020. The following is what I am doing and what I'm tracking for the term of this project. This is The Plan.

##### Visual, Performance Art, and Music

I want to maintain a studio practice while experimenting with new materials in new mediums to create goods. I want to compose music, learn theory, train my voice, practice instruments while listening more, curating more, DJing and VJing. I really want to sing. I'm going to print. I'm going to party.

##### Screenwriting, Creative Writing, Radio/Television/Film

I'm taking a screenwriting class, and learning about film and cinematography. I want to do something meaningful with this knowledge: tell stories, work with my friends. I plan to ship sophisticated content to every writing project I started this year. Getting the sites live took some time but summer provides an opportunity to begin writing and schedule around the writing. I am composing a book and my blogs are my warmup.

##### Personal and Professional Development

Instead of working, I am working on myself. I won't accept a job offer until spring 2021. I want a full-time job at that time but not sooner. Until then, I need to be alone to work privately. I want to be healthy and well. I want to be peaceful. There should be no pressure on me for the duration of my project. I am interested in building out the businesses and ventures I have started. Business is as valuable to me as my career.

##### Physical Care

Using a beauty/exercise regimen and nutrition, I want to change my looks and body. I have to get in better shape. I want to increase my fitness and make no excuses, overcoming all aspects of the body which keep me down. I am investing in good sleep as well as correct morning, afternoon, and evening routines for me. I need to fix my posture and breathing. It is important to improve my image to be better integrated in society, more confident, and a popular subject of photos and video.

##### Culture, Internet, Information and Collaboration

I want to store and use the work of other contemporaries for my reference. I will keep a list, and keep my own archive...moodboards of my research. My defensible worldview will come from this body. The collection will be representative of my state of mind. Learning language and use is very important to me: Hindi, Punjabi, French, Spanish, even English. I want to be eloquent and properly versed. Collaboration and working with others is also important to me. 

##### The Truth About Home

The last and largest thing is coming to terms with what has happened in my family. This is all I can say and remain karmically clear. In two years, I want to have gone through enough with myself and my own work that my life and childhood don't matter and the rest of my past doesn't matter anymore. This is my coming of age and these are the end of my twenties. I want to forget you.
